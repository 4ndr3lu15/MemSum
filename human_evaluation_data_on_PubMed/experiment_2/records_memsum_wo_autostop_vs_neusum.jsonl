", "they noted that network size varies considerably , because participants can nominate up to 24 network members .  ", "thus , when participants ' support ratings of network members are summed , nssq support scores may be confounded from extraneous variance from network size , and this is especially problematic when using total network scores versus specific network relationship scores .  ", "that is , because more network members implies more support , support scores from the entire network most heavily reflect both support ratings and number of supporters listed .   recognizing this problem , some investigators use averaged scores ( support ratings divided by network size ) to remove the influence of network size variability", ". however , though effective in removing the effects of network size variability , as fully detailed below , norbeck   discouraged this practice , cautioning that averaging can unduly lower scores of some participants with large networks .   though this may be true , to date , the effects of averaging on support scores as network size increases have not been investigated .  ", "moreover , because extraneous variance due to network size variability in raw scores increases measurement error , averaged scores continue to be used .

", "second , we evaluate the statistical efficiency of averaged versus raw scores by comparing the powers of their correlations with a reasonable criterion variable .  ", "the conceptual basis for the nssq [ 1 , 2 ] is kahn 's   definition of social support , and it thus includes measures of functional support ( affect , affirmation , and aid ) , network size , and network relationships .   for this reason , the nssq was commended in house and kahn 's   classic work on social support concepts and measures , where they urged investigators to consider all three of these aspects of support , because network size is a  necessary condition and hence a partial determinant ", "( page 85 ) of network relationships and the types of support given .   due to its comprehensive scope and extensive ongoing psychometric evaluation [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 68 ]", ", it is one of the most widely used social support measures in nursing research .  ", "in fact , since its inception in 1981 , the nssq has been used in over 250 studies published in peer - reviewed journals , and its use increases each year .", "one reason for its widespread use is that unlike other network - based support inventories , the nssq is completed by the participant without input from an interviewer .  ", "this makes it ideal for use in large - scale studies such as mailed surveys .  ", "because of this self - report feature , the nssq requires a unique layout .  ", "specifically , participants are first asked to list from 1 to 24 network members  who provide personal support for you or who are important to you  and then specify their relationship ( spouse , parent , friend , etc . ) .   after completing the network list ,", "they are instructed to successively turn the half pages and rate each listed network member ( 04 ) on six functional support questions measuring three types of support : affect , affirmation , and aid ( see table 1 ) .  ", "normative data ( n = 1,067 )   shows that the average network size is 10.9 members , but the high standard deviation of this average ( 5.9 ) reveals the considerable variability between reported network sizes .  ", "this is because participants ' network size is dependent on many factors , including how influenced participants are by the presence of 24 spaces as well as the size of their immediate and extended family .  ", "for example , family ( other than spouse ) is the most often listed relationship , so a participant with two living parents , a spouse , and four children may list up to seven immediate family members plus supportive siblings , friends , neighbors , and so forth .  ", "in contrast , a participant with deceased parents , a spouse , and two children will only have three possible immediate family members to list .    because support ratings for each network member are summed", ", support scores ( range = 0576 ) vary greatly due to network size alone .  ", "thus , the above participant with seven immediate family members functionally inflates his / her support score .  ", "in fact , in the three samples [ 911 ] used in the present study , network size was very highly correlated with affect scores ( .95 ,  .94 ,  and  .95 ,  resp . ) and affirmation scores ( .92 ,  .90 ,  and  .92 ,  resp . ) and a bit less with aid scores ( .81 ,  .82 ,  and  .82 ,  resp . ) .  ", "it is likely that aid 's lower correlations with network size are the result of more participants giving some network members aid ratings of 0 than giving 0 's for affect or affirmation ratings .  ", "when this happens , the participant has effectively dropped that person from their network , and thus reduced the influence of network size on that support score .  ", "this happens most often with aid , because some participants list network members who may like ( affect ) and agree with ( affirmation ) them but be unable to provide tangible help ( aid ) such as children , elderly parents , and peripheral network members .  ", "in fact , in the present study 's third sample , where data were entered at this level of specificity ( i.e. , affect , affirmation , and aid scores from each network member ) , it was determined that for aid scores , 33% of participants gave a 0 aid rating to at least 1 network member , and 20% of participants gave more than 1 network member a 0 aid rating .  ", "in contrast , only 9% of participants gave a 0 affect rating , and 19% gave a 0 affirmation rating .  ", "few participants gave more than one network member a 0 rating for affect or affirmation questions .", "in summary , though nssq support scores are meant to measure quantity of support , they have two determinants of variability : support ratings and network size .  ", "therefore , raw support scores can not be taken at face value but should be viewed as support ratings relative to network size .  ", "for this reason , many investigators remove the influence of network size variability by averaging nssq scores , that is , dividing the support score by the network size .   ", "averaging is not a problem when participants rate all network members uniformly highly or lowly .  ", "for example , participant a lists 7 highly supportive network members , and participant b lists 14 equally supportive members .  ", "b 's score ( 305 ) is higher than a 's ( 154 ) only because she listed more network members .  ", "however , a 's and b 's averaged support scores ( a ( 154/7 = 22 ) and b ( 305/14 = 21.79 ) ) reflect their support quality relative to their respective network sizes .  ", "this is because only their network sizes varied ; their support ratings were consistently high .  ", "all of their network members uniformly liked them ( affect ) , agreed with them ( affirmation ) , and could help them ( aid ) , but this equality among network members is not typical .    in a typical nssq network , only a few supporters give large amounts of all three types of support and the others contribute in varying degrees , and this reflects reality .  ", "that is , some network members make one feel loved and/or are good confidants but can not offer tangible support and vice versa .  ", "this pattern is typified by participant c : like b , participant c has a relatively large network ( 14 ) , but unlike b , her network members ' ratings were more varied .  ", "c rated 7 network members highly on most support questions but varied the ratings of the other 7 network members giving some high and some low ratings for some types of support .  ", "though both a and c each have 7 highly supportive network members and c has 7 additional network members giving some support , c 's averaged score ( 277/14 = 19.79 ) is 2.21 points lower than a 's ( 154/7 = 22 ) .  ", "because of variations in her ratings , unlike b , c 's numerator ( support score ) did not keep up with her denominator ( network size ) .   ", "of course , it is possible that this  deflation  of averaged scores happens at all network sizes .  ", "in fact , if averaging lowered scores consistently for all participants , then lowered scores due to averaging would be the norm and would result in true regressions to the mean .  ", "thus , as is the case with uniformly high or low ratings , if all participants vary their support ratings averaging is again not a problem .  ", "norbeck   was concerned , however , because participants ' support ratings show increased variability with increased network size .  ", "that is , the more people one has in his / her network ( denominator ) , the more room for variability of ratings ( numerator ) and the more chance that one 's score will be unduly lowered by averaging if the numerator does not keep pace with the denominator .   indeed , we saw previously that raw support scores increase as network size increases as evidenced by the high positive correlations .  ", "thus , the question is whether averaging results in a statistically significant lowering of ( averaged ) scores as network size increases .  ", "the potential for this is greatest for total network scores and less so for source - specific scores due to the smaller denominators ( one relationship category ) .   ", "nevertheless , though norbeck 's   concern about the effects of averaging may be warranted , one must also be aware of the effects of using support scores which contain variability due to network size .  ", "for example , if high support is related to low stress but support scores are reflective of support as well as network size , it is likely that the size of the relation between support and stress will be reduced .  ", "this is due to measurement error or the extraneous variance present in support scores resulting from network size variability .  ", "thus , the risk of making a type 2 error ( failing to detect a real effect ) may be greater when using raw support scores , and the deleterious effects of averaging , if any , must be weighed against their beneficial effects in terms of explained variance in the criterion variable .", "is there a statistically significant negative correlation between averaged total functional support scores ( entire network ) and number in network ?", "in addition , are there statistically significant negative correlations between averaged affect , affirmation , and aid scores ( entire network ) and number in network ?", "does using averaged total functional support scores provide a measure less infected with extraneous variance and thus produce a more efficient measure than raw total functional support scores ?  ", "do averaged total functional support scores yield higher powers than raw scores produced under the same conditions ? similarly , do averaged affect , affirmation , and aid scores provide an analysis with a higher power than respective analyses with raw scores ?", "with institutional review board approval , a secondary analysis was conducted on data from three different samples [ 911 ] of women who were mothers attending college for their first postsecondary school degree .  ", "the same data collection protocol was used in all three studies : participation was invited during a brief in - class presentation of the study , and participants completed the self - administered surveys on their own time and anonymously returned surveys in postage - paid envelopes addressed to the first author .  ", "response rates were high ( 66% , 45% , and 57% , resp . ) .  ", "along with the nssq , participants completed the perceived multiple role stress scale   and role involvement questionnaires   as well as a demographic data sheet .", "table 2 shows that these samples ' ( ( n = 157 ) ; ( n = 263 ) ; ( n = 189 ) ) parametric properties are consistent with norbeck 's   normative data for community dwelling adult females ( n = 1,067 ) .   though norbeck gives no information concerning network size distribution , the majority ( 75% ) of participants in the present study 's samples listed 14 network members , and 50% listed 10 - 11 members .  ", "all samples ' total functional support scores were statistically significantly nonnormal , showing positive skews ( 5.78 , 3.32 , and 5.60 , resp . ) , and all except sample two showed statistically significantly positive kurtoses ( 3.5 and 4.54 ) .   these findings are consistent with findings concerning normality throughout the nssq literature .

fiber dysfunction can be based upon skin biopsies , with measurement of the density of thin , unmyelinated nerve fibers using immunohistochemistry for protein gene product 9.5 ( pgp-9.5 ) as a neuronal marker.12,13,15,16,21,22 since description of the utility of pgp- 9.5 as a marker for ienf in human skin,23 it has been used for identification of small nerve fibers in the dermis and epidermis in a range of small fiber neuropathies , including human immunodeficiency virus , and idiopathic small fiber and postherpetic neuralgia , among others.13,15,2429 in addition , we have now established that there are characteristic changes in ienf that distinguish the metabolic syndrome from diabetes .", "30 ienf density was recently given a level a recommendation by the european federation of the neurological societies and the peripheral nerve society as a reliable and efficient technique to confirm the clinical diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy.31 the ienf density has been shown to correlate inversely with cold and heat detection thresholds.32 a oneyear diet and exercise intervention program in patients with small fiber neuropathy and impaired glucose tolerance led to increased ienf density.33 ienf loss is evident early in the disease process , declines with increasing neuropathic pain , and can be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials.31,33 apart from the one -

developed countries.55 it is estimated that the coverage of skilled attendance at birth is improving at a rate of less than 0.5% per year,56 thus it will be many years until we see adequate coverage at delivery ; alternative solutions are needed . for many developing countries , poor storage conditions and deficient public sector supply chains also contribute to the limited access to and utilization of uterotonic drugs .", "the storage of oxytocin and ergometrine can be particularly challenging , due to their instability in high temperatures and sensitivity to light.51,57 additionally , because these two drugs are only available in injection form , their administration is limited to skilled providers .", "finally , in some settings where oxytocin and ergometrine are accessible , procurement of unregistered drugs may be prolific and the quality of the drugs may be compromised .", "for example , in ghana , researchers found 89% ( n=90 ) of all ampoules of oxytocin and ergometrine tested did not meet the specifications for the active ingredient , which was not a result of being expired ; this problem was present in both the public and private sector.58 on the other hand , misoprostol is reportedly more stable , available in tablet form , and can be provided through multiple routes of administration.59 however , all uterotonics can be exposed to health system failures , such as the case of oxytocin in tanzania and ethiopia , where the drugs were available but not properly distributed to health facilities.60,61 even when available , uterotonics are not always used consistently to prevent pph .", "a survey of 15 tertiary level facilities ( including 452 vaginal deliveries ) conducted by the global network for perinatal and reproductive health showed that prophylactic oxytocin was used in 44% of the cases and was the least used of the three components of amtsl assessed ( use of early cord clamping was 79% and use of controlled cord traction was 70%).62 for home births without a skilled provider , misoprostol has been distributed using a variety of approaches with or without a safe delivery kit , including distribution at antenatal care visits , at household visits by community health workers during pregnancy , at home births assisted by traditional birth attendants , and in some instances , through a combination of these methods.63 none of these approaches are without challenges related to access and utilization of the drug . for example", ", antenatal care distribution is only effective in increasing access to this drug in those settings where the majority of women who will deliver at home also attend antenatal care .", "furthermore , if advanced distribution of misoprostol requires a specific gestational age among eligible women ( eg , in mozambique , this is 28 weeks gestation ; in bangladesh , this is 32 weeks),64,65 only those attending antenatal care after the required gestational age would receive the drug and be able to use it in home births .", "separate from the interventions themselves is the health care system in which these interventions are being implemented .", "the continuum of care is an important consideration because these interventions in isolation will likely not be enough to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality .", "these interventions are not a replacement for a weak health care infrastructure and limited health care personnel , which must not be forgotten in this discussion of pph prevention interventions .", "the implementation of effective approaches is also dependent on the timely translation of research findings into policies and programs , which remains a considerable barrier in accelerating pph prevention efforts .", "in general , the translation of research into clinical practice is often conceptualized as proceeding from awareness through acceptance to adoption.66 however , decades may pass before research findings are integrated into guidelines and routine clinical practice ( see figure 1 ) .", "there is no agreement or set of rules among policy makers regarding the amount of evidence needed ( ie , number and type of studies ) to prompt changes in policies and programs . as mentioned before , by 2007 , there was only one rct published on the use of misoprostol in home births , which prompted mathai et al to express , after the 2007 release of the who guidelines , that there was  insufficient evidence for the safe use of misoprostol by lay providers in nonfacility settings.67 nonetheless , based solely on the evidence of its efficacy in clinical settings and encouraged by the potential impact that misoprostol could have in the absence of oxytocin , many countries had already begun conducting operations research to test its safety , feasibility , and acceptability for home births , even before consensus was reached and the official guidelines were in place.68,69 eventually , a placebo - controlled rct with traditional birth attendants was conducted , from 2006 to 2008 , in pakistan.45 similar to the history of misoprostol , but with less debate , amtsl was first described in 1962,11 but the first rct comparing amtsl with expectant management was not done until 1988,12 and the official guidelines and policies were not adapted until later,13 after many countries had already begun to incorporate this practice .", "the evidence of the relative importance of its components has only become available in the last 3 years , prompting the who to review its recommendations ( see table 1 ) .", "finally , the challenges in the use of evidence to recommend improvements in the quality of care are further complicated by the delays in provider uptake of practices based on new knowledge .", "even when health providers recognize and accept guidelines , they may fail to adopt them,70 and pph prevention efforts are no exception.62 as noted , the translation of research into policy is often a long and inconsistent process , and the prioritization of a health intervention based solely on costs or cost - effectiveness is an equally challenging proposition .", "however , in resource - poor settings , the reduction of maternal mortality in the most cost - effective way possible should be a priority to policy makers.71 in a modeling exercise , the prevention of pph with advanced distribution of misoprostol was found to be very cost - effective in resource - poor settings , relative to other maternal - health interventions included in the who mother - baby package , only preceded by family planning and safe abortion.72 the cost of each intervention recommended by the who might differ due to the cost of each uterotonic.67 the costs of services also depend on the level of health facility and provider involved .", "however , given that pph is the main cause of maternal death , saving lives with any pph prevention intervention is an effective way to reduce overall maternal mortality , which is the goal of every developing country , in accordance with the united nations millennium development goal ( mdg ) 5 .", "an economic assessment of the reduction of pph in developing countries estimated that the consistent use of a conventional uterotonic in every birth could avert 41 million cases of pph , resulting in an estimated 1.4 million lives saved.73 specifically with regard to misoprostol , an article utilizing modeling techniques determined that misoprostol use for pph prevention is a cost - effective intervention that could reduce maternal deaths by approximately 38%.74", "one of the greatest opportunities in pph prevention is the fact that the currently available evidence is sufficient to establish policies and programs that will increase access to effective interventions in low - resource settings . in order to leverage this opportunity", ", countries must establish a supportive national policy , which starts with the adoption of national guidelines for pph prevention that reflect the latest research and the most recent who recommendations.3,20 early on , it is important to identify local champions who will engage policy makers and clinicians.75 with respect to misoprostol , countries must register it for pph prevention and ensure its inclusion on the national essential medicines list.20 the next step for any of the interventions is to secure adequate funding in the national budget to ensure the consistent availability of the drugs and the training of health care providers.20 with regards to misoprostol , correct use by community health workers and women could be increased if misoprostol is procured in indication -

third of patients.1214 uncontrolled severe asthma accounts for ~15% of all asthma patients but is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality as well as an important impact on health care costs and the consumption of resources.15 the asmacost study16 based on data of a prospective cohort of 627 patients throughout spain with asthma diagnosed according to the guidelines of the global initiative for asthma ( gina)17 and the adapted spanish criteria ( gua espaola de manejo del asma [ gema])9 and followed up for 12 months revealed that the total societal cost for asthma was 1,726  per patient annually ( 1,533  to the national health service ) , with higher costs for patients older than 65 years and for those with a more severe disease ( 2,635  for severe asthma ) .", "based on these findings , the total annual cost of asthma in spain was estimated to be 1,480 million euros . on the other hand ,", "70% of total costs were attributed to the poor control of the disease , which further reinforces the need to achieve clinical stability of the patients as it has been repeatedly emphasized in clinical practice guidelines.9,17 from another perspective , poor asthma control is a determining factor of the high indirect costs related to absenteeism and reduced productivity . in a naturalistic and observational study ( tenor study ) of 4,756 asthma patients recruited in 283 study sites from diverse geographical areas in the usa and followed up for 24 months , the mean annual costs for uncontrolled patients with difficult - to - treat asthma were more than double of those for controlled patients throughout the study.18 different studies carried out in other countries have obtained similar results.1921 moreover , chronic comorbidities contribute to the burden and costs of persistent asthma,22 and poor adherence to asthma medication regimens , including patients with difficult - to - control asthma , is a key problem contributing to poor disease control.23 adherence to asthma treatment in patients with uncontrolled difficult asthma is highly relevant , since treatments currently considered for step - up therapy ( biologics , bronchial thermoplasty)9,17 are very expensive and , in many cases , are prescribed without adequate adherence to drug regimens in the lower steps.24 a further interesting aspect concerns to deficiencies in the development and implementation of effective education programs for asthma patients , promotion of health , and social support . it has been demonstrated that education in self - management of asthma with symptom or peak flow monitoring , combined with regular medical visits and written action plans , is effective in improving health outcomes in adults with asthma.25,26 in a 1-year cluster randomized controlled multicenter study with the participation of 230 adults with mild - to - moderate persistent uncontrolled asthma , an asthma educational program based on a repeated short intervention , given in four face - to - face sessions at 3-month intervals was effective in improving asthma symptom control , future risk , and quality of life.27 in this study , the education program included administration of a written personalized action plan and training on inhaler technique.27 other experiences reported similar results . in a controlled clinical trial in which a comprehensive asthma intervention program was evaluated in a population of medicaid - insured asthmatic children , a significant improvement in health outcomes ( emergency department visits , hospitalizations ) and asthma health care costs was observed in the intervention group in the year after enrollment.28 in a randomized patient selection study with crossover , a vigorous medical regimen and intensive educational program were able to decrease hospital use among a group of adult asthmatics who had previously required repeated readmissions for acute asthma exacerbations.29 in a large teaching hospital ( glasgow royal infirmary ) where asthma management was audited prospectively for 1 year , treatment of asthma patients in wards with a specialist interest in respiratory medicine was associated with a reduction in the rate of readmissions compared to patients admitted to general wards without this special interest ( 2% vs. 20%).30 given the complexity and multiple factors involved in the control of asthma , there is a need for establishing asthma units involved in the care of asthma patients , especially those patients with severe difficult - to - control disease .", "however , up to the present time , a few studies have demonstrated that assessment and management of patients in specific units for severe asthma are associated with substantial benefits in terms of health ( asthma control , quality of life ) and reduction in economic burden . in a study of 346 patients with severe asthma referred to specialist centers across the uk and followed up for a median of 286 days , significant reductions in health - care use ( primary care or emergency department visits ) , hospital admissions , and steroid dose were observed , which were accompanied by significant improvements in quality of life and asthma control.31 in a crossover study carried out in spain , treatment of patients in asthma clinics was cost - effective and beneficial in asthma management in comparison with standard outpatient services.32 the national asthma program in finland , probably one of the most outstanding health care networks for asthma patients , has shown that integration of different health care levels involved in the management of asthma ( pneumologists , primary care physicians , and pharmacists ) improves control of the disease and reduces the morbidity of asthma.33", "the separ has promoted the task of accrediting the levels of the different asthma units already existing in our country , with the following objectives : 1 ) to improve the level of care of asthma patients , ensuring a framework of quality of care ; 2 ) to establish resources and facilitating their management ; 3 ) to promote the development of training plans in asthma and to advance in the concept of  accreditation of knowledge  ; 4 ) to favor collaboration with professionals from other clinical disciplines in a cooperative environment ; and 5 ) to promote asthma research . within the separ training framework , a manual on severe", "asthma and difficult -
