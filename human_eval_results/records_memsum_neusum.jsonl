blind placebo lead - ins , concomitant medications ) , and other issues.41 excessive placebo response in clinical trials includes expectancy bias ( in patients and investigators ) , incentives , rater reliability , and data quality.42 similar issues were observed in antidepressant rct . the placebo response rate doubled between 1980 and 2000.43 the relatively modest effects of antidepressants ( in comparison with placebo ) in contemporary rct , as well as", "the lack of attention being paid to the contribution of placebo expectancy factors to individual outcomes , have often been underestimated .", "however , the modest benefits of antidepressants observed in grouped datasets may obscure large , specific , and very meaningful therapeutic effects for 10% to 20% of those treated with antidepressants.44 on the other hand , the placebo - controlled trial is the standard method used to verify the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic agents for the treatment of schizophrenia.45 currently , superiority over placebo is the only acceptable and reliable proof of efficacy of new antipsychotic medications.46,47 without the placebo - controlled design , one can not show that improvements in symptoms do not represent nonspecific treatment effects or the natural course of the disease.45 also , in trials intended to show that a new drug is equivalent to established drugs , a variety of problems may reduce the power to detect clinically significant differences between the new drug and the active comparator.48,49 furthermore , without a placebo comparator , one can not affirm whether the apparent equivalence of the standard and the new antipsychotic drug has occurred because the clinical population recruited for a study is nonresponsive to both drugs . in addition , if the experimental drug is ineffective and/or unsafe , the larger sample size required for noninferiority testing may expose more patients to harmful side effects or ineffective treatment compared with placebo - controlled designs.45 the placebo - controlled trial can protect research participants from the harmful effects of ineffective drugs.50 in terms of the clinical efficacy of antipsychotic agents , we are usually interested in treatment response and remission . in clinical trials , the efficacy of antipsychotics is measured through the use of scales like bprs51 or panss.52 among the available trials , there is no agreement in terms of when to consider a clinical response with an antipsychotic agent ; different trials report that a response could be considered when reductions from the initial scores of 20% , 30% , 40% , 50% , and 60% are found.53 some studies using data from a large number of subjects,5458 rated simultaneously with the bprs / panss and the clinical global impression scale ( cgi),59 concluded that a 25% reduction in the bprs / panss baseline scores is associated with a minimal improvement in the cgi score ; moreover , a 50% reduction in the bprs / panss scores would correspond with  much improved  scores in the cgi .", "remission is defined as a lack of significant symptoms . to obtain a uniformly accepted definition of remission ,", "a group of experts60 proposed that a patient can be considered as being in remission if eight items on the panss52 or corresponding items on the bprs,51 scale for the assessment of positive symptoms,61 or on the scale for the assessment of negative symptoms56 are rated as being  mildly present  or better.62 other important outcome measures in schizophrenia trials include relapse and recovery .", "relapse can be defined in different ways : exacerbation or recurrence of symptoms , change in functional status or change in treatment requirements , intensity of services , or locus of care.53 some studies define relapse when patients need to be hospitalized.6369 we have to remember that hospitalization due to social causes should not be considered as relapse .", "also , some patients can be treated when presenting with worsening symptoms while avoiding hospitalization .", "recovery is the goal of the treatment of patients with schizophrenia , and improvement of symptoms requires improvement of functional measures .", "recovery is influenced by psychosocial treatments , family and community supports , supportive employment , and supportive education.53 there are many scales that measure clinical efficacy in schizophrenia trials .", "the following scales evaluate clinical symptomatology:53 \n cgi severity and improvement scale59bprs51panss52scale for the assessment of negative symptoms62calgary depression rating scale70 cgi severity and improvement scale59 scale for the assessment of negative symptoms62 calgary depression rating scale70", "the importance of subjective measures has been repeatedly addressed in studies on the quality of life of patients with schizophrenia.71,72 improvement in quality of life and social functioning , with consequent reintegration into society , is clearly a major goal of treatment for schizophrenia.17,73 some studies have shown that the type of antipsychotic medication could influence treatment nonadherence .", "the use of atypical antipsychotics can improve adherence when compared with fga . in some studies", ", the use of atypical antipsychotics was seen to be associated with greater treatment adherence relative to conventional neuroleptics.7476 it has been suggested that better control of negative symptoms and fewer eps during treatment with sga are associated with better adherence to treatment.77 moreover , some studies suggest that patients receiving sga have better subjective responses to their current medication than those receiving conventional medications.7880 however , a prospective study reported that there was no difference between sga and fga in terms of adherence to treatment.81 patients subjective well -

infected patients aged 2554 years was over two - fold higher than in the us general outpatient population ( 84.2 versus 35.6 fractures per 10,000 people , adjusted for gender).6 hiv - infected patients have been shown to be at particularly high risk for developing fractures if they are aged 47 years ( compared with 35 years ) , have a history of cd4 cell count below 200/mm , have diabetes or hepatitis c coinfection , or are an intravenous drug user.6 because combination antiretroviral therapy has allowed more and more hiv - infected people to live well beyond 50 years , when osteoblastic activity significantly declines,1 the occurrence of fractures is expected to increase in this population in the future", ". the higher prevalence of fractures among hiv - infected patients compared with the general population is due in part to their lower bone mineral density , which makes their bones more fragile and susceptible to breaking.1,4,6,13 this is reflected in their six - fold higher rate of osteopenia and nearly four - fold higher rate of osteoporosis.6 for every one standard deviation reduction in vertebral bone mineral density , there is a two - fold increased risk of vertebral fracture.1 hiv itself appears to lower bone mineral density due to the presence of increased levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines ( interleukin-1 , interleukin-6 , and tumor necrosis factor ) that directly accelerate bone loss.13 many antiretroviral and nonantiretroviral drugs are also known to contribute to low bone mineral density through a variety of mechanisms , including enhanced osteoclastic activity , reduction in osteoblastic activity , impaired calcium absorption , and renal phosphate wasting.8,13 of the reverse transcriptase inhibitors , the nucleotide , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , has been most documented to produce significant reductions in bone mineral density following initiation of therapy.10,1925 in clinical trials that have directly compared tenofovir with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors , ie , stavudine , zidovudine , and abacavir , tenofovir was found to reduce bone mineral density to a greater degree.22,26,27 in a cross - sectional observational study by guillemi et al10 in 285 unselected adult hiv patients ( 80% caucasian , 85% male , median age 48 years ) , multivariate analysis revealed that tenofovir exposure for at least three months and lower body mass index , but not exposure to other nucleosides or protease inhibitors , were risk factors for low bone mineral density .", "to date , studies of fractures in hiv - infected patients have focused primarily on fractures of the hip and spine , as confirmed by dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dexa ) or magnetic resonance imaging.4,14,18,21,28 fractures of the feet have rarely been mentioned in any publication . considering their weight - bearing role ,", "feet would be expected to be highly vulnerable to fracture in hiv patients , especially those with reduced bone mineral density and the common hiv - associated peripheral neuropathy .", "the purpose of the present study was to describe the clinical , laboratory , and medical history characteristics of all male hiv -

infected patients treated with tenofovir - containing haart than non - tenofovir - containing haart .", "concern about an association of tenofovir with fractures was initially raised by preclinical studies that showed a higher risk of spontaneous fractures and bone abnormalities in rhesus monkeys with simian immunodeficiency virus infection administered supratherapeutic doses of tenofovir ( 30 mg / kg / day ) subcutaneously for one week to 24 months ( mean , 14 months ) compared with no treatment .", "31 these bone effects were associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and decreased serum phosphorus levels .", "histomorphometric assessment of the tibial diaphyses in tenofovir - treated monkeys revealed increased osteoid seam width , consistent with defective mineralization of new bone , despite reduction or reversal of tibial bone resorption . a further preclinical study reported completely unmineralized secondary osteons in the tibia of a 16-month - old rhesus monkey whose mother had received high doses of tenofovir while pregnant.32 clinical trials evaluating tenofovir have also demonstrated the adverse effect of the drug on bone . in gs-99 - 903 , a clinical registration trial that compared tenofovir / lamivudine / efavirenz ( n = 299 ) with stavudine / lamivudine / efavirenz ( n = 303 ) in antiretroviral - nave patients , tenofovir - treated patients experienced a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral density at week 144 ( 2.2% versus 1.0% stavudine , p = 0.001 ) and a trend for greater bone mineral density reduction at the hip ( 2.8% versus 2.4% stavudine , p = 0.06).26 two subsequent clinical trials similarly showed that tenofovir , whether combined with emtricitabine or lamivudine , caused significantly greater bone mineral density reduction than comparator nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbones.21,28 however , none of these clinical trials reported a significantly higher frequency of fractures in tenofovir - treated patients despite the tenofovir - associated reduction in bone mineral density .", "this underscores clinical evidence demonstrating that reduced bone mineral density is just one contributor to fractures and that bone mineral density alone can not serve as the only predictor of fracture .", "in fact , reduced bone mineral density alone generally imparts less than 25% increased risk of vertebral fractures.33 the effect of decreased bone mineral density on foot fracture risk has yet to be investigated . where fracture data have been reported previously in hiv - infected patients receiving haart , these have dealt primarily with vertebral fractures rather than foot fractures .", "in fact , in an assessment of patient medical records of approximately 8600 hiv - infected patients ( 78% male , 70% caucasian , median age 45 years , 46% smokers , 81% of the haart regimens including one protease inhibitor and 22% including tenofovir ) at nine us hiv clinics , 55% of 55 fractures observed were vertebral , only one of which occurred with a concurrent foot fracture.14 the other most frequent sites of fracture were the lower extremities ( 27% , which could have included foot fractures , although these were not specified ) , upper extremities ( 6% ) , and clavicle ( 4% ) .", ", patients who had fractures generally remained on the antiretroviral treatment they had been receiving at the time fracture occurred , and remediation similarly consisted of immobilization of the fracture areas , with institution of calcium , vitamin d , and bisphosphonates if osteoporosis had been detected by bone mineral density measurements .", "foot fractures believed to be related to tenofovir were previously reported in several hiv - infected patients , aged 3762 years , 1217 months after tenofovir was added to their haart regimens.24,34,35 their regimens also included either ritonavir - boosted atazanavir or lopinavir . in these cases ,", "bone scintigraphy revealed concurrent fissure fractures in multiple body areas , especially the legs , ribs , pelvis , and femur .", "laboratory work confirmed osteomalacia that was likely due to tenofovir - related proximal renal tubular dysfunction , which was marked by phosphaturia , proteinuria , glycosuria , and calciuria .", "tenofovir was discontinued , remedial oral 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 , neutral sodium - potassium phosphate , and/or calcitriol treatment was initiated , and the condition of the patients resolved and laboratory values and renal function usually normalized within 12 weeks .", "generalized fractures in 12 of 22 patients who had developed proximal renal tubular dysfunction secondary to tenofovir were also reported by woodward et al.25 in these patients , phosphaturia led to hypophosphatemia , which in turn led to osteomalacia and fracture . in the tenofovir - treated patients in our study ,", "osteomalacia could not be ruled out as a potential cause of , or prodromal condition for , foot fractures because we did not have serum phosphate data , or urinary phosphate , glucose , or protein data .", "our tenofovir cohort did not present with a greater number of symptoms suggestive of generalized osteomalacia ( diffuse body pain and muscle weakness ) than did the non - tenofovir group .", "however , it did have more stress - type and concurrent fractures and higher parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels , all of which are often associated with osteomalacia.36 both the tenofovir and non - tenofovir groups in our study had several factors that could have influenced the occurrence of foot fractures", ". a larger proportion of tenofovir - treated patients took the protease inhibitor lopinavir / ritonavir concurrently . because lopinavir / ritonavir increases tenofovir blood levels by inhibiting the efflux of tenofovir out of renal proximal tubule cells and reduces tenofovir renal clearance , the increased tenofovir blood levels during concurrent use", "could have potentially increased fracture risk , in view of animal studies linking higher tenofovir concentrations with greater demineralization.31,32 in addition , lopinavir / ritonavir in the absence of coadministered tenofovir has been linked with low bone mineral density and cases of accelerated osteoporosis,37 and with vertebral fractures.38 more of our tenofovir - treated cohort took oral corticosteroids , were chronic cigarette smokers , and had truncal obesity or wasting syndrome , all of which have been implicated in reducing bone mineral density.3942 these factors could have contributed to the higher frequency of osteoporosis or osteopenia in the tenofovir group , and hence greater likelihood of foot bone fragility and fracture .", "these risk factors were likely partially counterbalanced by the greater frequency of use of calcium supplements , vitamin d , testosterone , and teriparatide , ie , drugs that could increase bone mineral density , in the tenofovir group.4347 it was not clear in some cases when these were started with respect to the timing of a diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis .", "although fewer patients in the non - tenofovir group had as many of these bone mineral density - reducing factors , more non - tenofovir - treated patients were alcoholics or had cd4 counts < 200/mm , both of which can lower bone mineral density.43,46 our study was limited by its small population and its lack of information about the dietary habits and exercise patterns of the patients , both of which could have potentially impacted bone strength , and hence , foot fracture risk .", "the study involved hiv - infected patients who were diagnosed over a one - year period ( 20062007 ) after having received tenofovir on average for about 2.5 years .", "thus , they were prescribed tenofovir at a time when the nucleoside backbones popularly used in practice were lamivudine / zidovudine , abacavir / lamivudine , and abacavir / lamivudine / zidovudine .", "it is noteworthy that tenofovir is currently prescribed much more often as a backbone in combination haart regimens .", "thus , if foot fractures were to be evaluated over the past year in haart - treated patients , the attributability of the fracture to tenofovir use could be debatable because more fractures might only reflect greater prevalence of tenofovir use in current clinical practice .", "our study had several attributes , including the fact that the patients were well matched for severity of hiv condition , family history of bone abnormalities , and time between hiv diagnosis and foot fracture diagnosis .", "most of the patients were not elderly , and so the effects of older age on bone fragility were negligible .", "the same data - gathering tool and questions were used in evaluating patient medical charts .", "lastly , only males were evaluated because women have a notably higher frequency of low bone mineral density due to smaller body weight and hormonal factors . in conclusion , this small pilot study suggests a greater incidence of foot fractures in hiv -

induced lever press ,", "the cue presentation is processed in the pfc and amygdala , communicated to the nacore , and then communicated to the dorsal striatum to access previously stored stimulus - response procedures coding the lever press response .", "communication between the ventral and dorsal striatum is largely via well - characterized , topographically organized thalamo - cortico - striatal circuitry that processes information arriving to the accumbens and then engaging dorsal striatal motor pattern generators to elicit the desired behavior . given the hierarchical organization of the striatum in processing stimuli that can elicit or modify a learned stimulus response , the nacore is positioned as the site where new information processed in pfc and allocortical brain regions arrives into the striatum to disrupt or suppress an intrusive thought .", "to illustrate the role of the nacore in how a stimulus response or habitual behavior can be disrupted by stimuli that require a behavior to change in order to remain adaptive , we again turn to the addiction literature .", "if the lever press for a drug is associated with an electric foot shock , the addicted animal will sustain substantially more foot shock than an animal trained to press for food .", "indeed , how difficult it is for the electric shock to disrupt a drug - seeking behavior can be viewed as an estimate of the extent to which the stimulus ( light / tone / context ) is intrusive and is commandeering the animal to maintain a maladaptive behavior ( pressing for drug ) in spite of a competing motivationally relevant stimulus ( shock ) .", "this indicates that chronic drug use has produced changes in how the striatum processes competing stimuli , thereby making the drug - associated stimulus - response behaviors more intrusive and difficult to disrupt .", "thus , the capacity of the addicted animal to keep responding in the presence of foot shock is similar to the person in mortal danger described above who is having an intrusive thought of escape and does not notice a foot injury sustained by stepping on a nail .", "in contrast , the food - responding animal pressing for food is not experiencing intrusive motivation to seek reward and responds appropriately to the foot shock pairing by inhibiting lever pressing . through the knowledge outlined above of", "how corticostriatal projections translate environmental stimuli and thoughts into behavior , we have identified the nacore as a portal for how motivationally relevant information is processed to guide behavior and to modify stimulus - response habits .", "accordingly , the nacore has become a site in the brain for focusing reductionist technologies to more mechanistically understand how enduring molecular and cellular changes are permitting maladaptive thoughts to become intrusive and trigger symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders .", "a recent animal study nicely illustrates that pfc synapses in the nacore are important in how competing , motivationally relevant information can disrupt an intrusive behavioral response , such as lever pressing , for an addictive drug . in this study ,", "maladaptive intrusive thoughts related to addiction were modeled in rats trained to use cocaine , and a subpopulation of the rats was identified that sustained relatively large foot shocks and continued to seek drug delivery triggered by a conditioned cue . by optically stimulating pfc inputs to the nucleus accumbens , these investigators effectively increased the capacity of foot shock to disrupt cocaine seeking .", "in other words , the stimulated rats demonstrated improved top - down control and were able to attend to the foot shock and update their lever pressing behavior in an adaptive manner ( in the case of this particular study , stop pressing for cocaine ) .", "the recent optogenetic study above was built upon nearly 20 years of previous animal research showing that enduring changes are produced in cortico - accumbens synapses by repeated administration of addictive drugs .", "the list of changes identified is prodigious and in some instances contradictory depending on the drug treatment protocol and the class of addictive drug the animal is using .", "for example , a very well - studied enduring synaptic effect of cocaine use is an increase in accumbens neuron dendritic spine density and size , but use of morphine or heroin produces the opposite effect on spine density and size .", "since by definition addiction disorders with all drug classes share an endophenotype of the motivation to take drugs becoming intrusive , the long list of drug - induced synaptic adaptations can be simplified by considering only molecular adaptations that are shared between classes of drugs and that endure during drug withdrawal .", "this rationale is similar to how dopamine release in the accumbens was identified as an obligatory mediator of reward learning .", "also , with these exclusion criteria , drug- and stress - induced adaptations at glutamatergic synapses have emerged as strong candidates for how a cue initiates a perseverative drug - seeking response .", "importantly , in many experiments , it has been shown that these adaptations are not produced in animals trained to self - administer a biological reward such as sucrose , indicating that they are potentially pathological markers of substance use disorders .", "figure 2 illustrates the primary adaptations elicited by presenting a drug - conditioned pavlovian cue to an animal withdrawn from training to self - administer an addictive drug , including rats and mice trained to use cocaine , heroin , nicotine , alcohol , or methamphetamine . when presentation of the drug - associated cue is processed in the pfc and allocortical regions , their glutamatergic projections to the nacore", "are activated to communicate the presence of a stimulus that will ultimately trigger a behavioral response ( eg , lever pressing for drug ) . since this is the same circuit for processing cues that achieve biological rewards ,", "one characteristic shared between addictive drugs , but not food training , is that in the nacore , the drug cues elicit glutamate spillover from the synaptic cleft .", "spillover occurs due to two separate enduring changes at glutamatergic synapses produced by repeated drug exposure .", "all drugs examined to date reduce the capacity of release - regulating presynaptic group ii metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mglur2/3 ) to negatively regulate synaptic glutamate release .", "this is accomplished by a drug - induced , enduring , downregulation of mglur2/3 protein or by upregulating ags3 ( activator of g - protein signaling 3 ) , a g - protein - binding protein that inhibits mglur2/3 intracellular signaling by sequestering and thereby functionally inactivating gi. simultaneously , chronic use of drugs or acute stress downregulates astroglial glutamate transporters ( eg , glutamate type 1 transporter [ glt-1 ] ) in nacore . because the glial glutamate transporters are densely distributed adjacent to the synaptic cleft , synaptic glutamate more effectively escapes uptake and enters the extrasynaptic space when glt-1 is downregulated .", "regardless of the combination of enduring changes produced by addictive drugs or stress , once in the extrasynaptic space , glutamate stimulation of group i metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ( mglur5 ) appears to be critical in regulating cue - induced drug seeking , since mglur5 antagonists administered systemically or directly into the nacore or nashell inhibit cued reinstatement of seeking for all drugs tested to date . in addition , for at least some drugs ( eg , heroin and nicotine ) , extrasynaptic stimulation of glun2b - containing n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) glutamate receptors contributes to cue - induced reinstatement of drug seeking .  ", "activation of mglur5 or glun2b stimulates the catabolism and sculpting of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) by activating gelatin - specific matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp2 , mmp9 ) activity in nacore . the mechanism for how these glutamate receptors stimulate mmps may involve synthesis of nitric oxide and n - nitrosylation of mmps ( unpublished observations ) .", "regardless , ecm digestion creates peptide ligands that bind to receptors on medium spiny neurons in the nacore , causing glutamatergic synapses to undergo transient synaptic potentiation ( t - sp ) . how the ecm signals t - sp is under investigation , but signaling through integrin receptors is a likely mechanism .", "three characteristics of cue - induced t - sp in the nacore make it a likely candidate mechanism for how a motivating environmental stimulus translates into an intrusive thought and maladaptive behavior .", "first , the transient nature of the potentiation means that it is eventually disrupted , and in animal models of cue induced drug seeking , the termination of synaptic potentiation parallels the animal no longer lever pressing for the cue .", "second , when the drug goal is achieved ( ie , the cue correctly predicts drug delivery ) , t - sp is terminated .", "this is akin to attending to your wounded foot after successful escape in the example above .", "third , the extent of t - sp is correlated with the intensity of drug seeking ( lever pressing ) and does not occur in cue - induced sucrose seeking considering these three characteristics , we hypothesize that the transient potentiation of the majority of glutamatergic synapses in the nacore by the drug cue reduces the capacity of medium spiny neurons to process motivationally relevant stimuli arriving after the cue that would normally adaptively change the animal 's behavior . in other words , because the pfc - nacore synapses normally coding a competing stimulus ( as a shock would compete for the drug - conditioned cue ) are already potentiated , these synapses will not properly code and transmit the information to dorsal striatal motor pattern circuits and will therefore not disrupt the ongoing behavior ( lever pressing ) .", "although the drug - associated cue is properly processed to initiate adaptive lever pressing , lever pressing becomes perseverative because competing stimuli can not effectively modulate nacore neurons and disrupt the ongoing behavior .", "thus , the already processed cue - induced lever pressing persists , and the drug cue becomes intrusive causing the animal to persistently relapse to drug seeking .", "figure 2 provides a number of sites for pharmacological intervention to clinically evaluate in treating neuropsychiatric diseases characterized in part by intrusive thoughts .", "indeed , every potential molecular target in figure 2 ( glt-1 , mglur2/3 , mglur5 , mmp , and integrins ) has been examined pharmacologically in animal models and shown to reduce cue - induced drug seeking , and mmp inhibitors simultaneously prevent the induction of t - sp ( none of the other targets have yet been examined in this regard ) .", "while many of these targets have generated compounds that have entered clinical trials for various disorders ( eg , mglur2/3 agonist for schizophrenia , mglur5 antagonist for fragile x , and mmp inhibitors in cancer ) , only glt-1 has been studied in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by intrusive thinking .", "specifically , n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) restores glt-1 activity in the nacore in animal models of addiction and has been examined in clinical trials for treating drug addiction , gambling , trichotillomania , depression , ptsd ( back se , unpublished data , 2016 ) , and ocd . while nac reduced drug use in most of the studies , even when nac did not successfully reduce drug use or relapse , there was a positive reduction in the desire to use the drug ( ie , intrusive thoughts related to drug use ) .", "similarly , in a trial for comorbid ptsd and substance use disorder , nac reduced drug craving and ptsd , and was particularly effective at reducing the ptsd symptom domain of intrusive thoughts ( back se , unpublished data , 2016 ) .", "thus , while a few trials with nac did not achieve the primary outcome of reducing or ameliorating the psychiatric disorder(s ) being examined , when a measure of intrusive thinking is evaluated , such as drug craving in addiction , this endophenotype is consistently reduced by nac .", "the fact that nac does not appear to be curative in treating neuropsychiatric disorders , but rather ameliorates the domain of intrusive thinking , speaks to the design of future clinical trials evaluating nac or other compounds that restore glt-1 ( see below ) .", "thus , by reducing intrusive thoughts , patients will have greater opportunity to cognitively regulate the emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms .", "for this reason , it seems logical to use nac in combination with other compounds with proven effectiveness in ameliorating a given disorder .", "for example , varenicline is the lead us food and drug administration - approved drug for treating cigarette addiction , and increases amygdala - accumbens resting state functional connectivity ( rsfc ) , while nac increases pfc - accumbens connectivity , supporting a view that combining varenicline and nac may be especially beneficial in treating addiction to cigarettes .   similarly , antidepressants normalize amygdala hyperactivity in treating depression , pointing to the possibility that antidepressant treatment of elevated amygdala activity combined with pfc -
